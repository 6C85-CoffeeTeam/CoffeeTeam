"Gutamela's Economy is largely represented by coffee productions

Not having enough water by the end of dry seasons.
The food they counted on to sell to have money to buy the things they needed does depended so narrowly and so particularly on the climate of that year, 

Everytime we had a draught, it hits the population really hard 
Millions of people are in this vulnerabilty let along climate change that challenges their livelihood. 
It reflects a larger challange and farmers in agriculutaes are tied to the timing of the amount of rainfall that comes during the wet season. 

The current coffee rust crisis has been linked to increasing temperature."

Persona: 

Name: Juan


I'm a coffee farmer from the Northern Triangle, and I'm struggling. My farm has been hit hard by droughts and coffee rust. The weather patterns have changed, and it's not like it used to be. We used to get plenty of rain, but now it's unpredictable. And the coffee rust has been devastating.
I wake up early every morning, hoping to see some rain clouds in the sky. But it's been weeks since we've had any significant rainfall. The coffee plants are suffering, and I'm afraid that if we don't get some rain soon, we'll lose the entire crop.
The coffee rust has also taken a toll on my farm. It's a disease that attacks the leaves of the coffee plants, and it's been spreading rapidly. I've tried everything to stop it, but nothing seems to work. The rust weakens the plants, and the yield of the crop is reduced.
It's hard to see my farm in this condition. I've worked hard for years to build it up, and now it's in jeopardy. But I'm not giving up.
I'm trying to adapt to the changing weather patterns. I've invested in new irrigation systems and water storage tanks, hoping to make the most of the rain when it does come. I've also started experimenting with new varieties of coffee plants that are more resistant to drought and rust.
