"Gutamela's Economy is largely represented by coffee productions

Not having enough water by the end of dry seasons.
The food they counted on to sell to have money to buy the things they needed does depended so narrowly and so particularly on the climate of that year, 

Everytime we had a draught, it hits the population really hard 
Millions of people are in this vulnerabilty let along climate change that challenges their livelihood. 
It reflects a larger challange and farmers in agriculutaes are tied to the timing of the amount of rainfall that comes during the wet season. 

The current coffee rust crisis has been linked to increasing temperature."

Persona: Juan Lopez
I'm a coffee farmer from Guatemala, owner of the Lopez’s farm operations in the Northern Triangle. Our economy is largely represented by coffee productions. We depend narrowly and very particularly on the climate to produce agricultural commodities to sell to sustain our lives. 

However, we have been struggling. Every time we had a draught, it hits the population in agriculture as hard as when there is an occurring coffee rust. 

The weather patterns have changed, and it's not like it used to be. We used to get plenty of rain, but now it's unpredictable. I wake up early every morning, hoping to see some rain clouds in the sky. But it's been weeks since we've had any significant rainfall. The coffee plants are suffering, and I'm afraid that if we don't get some rain soon, we'll lose the entire crop.

What makes it even wore is the devastating coffee rust which has taken a toll on my farm. It's a disease that attacks the leaves of the coffee plants, and it's been spreading rapidly. The rust weakens the plants, and the yield of the crop is reduced. It's hard to see my farm in this condition. I've worked hard for years to build it up, and now it's in jeopardy. 

We have thought about immigrating up north for a better source of income and livelihood, but we were limited by financial situations caused by the decline of coffee farming which we are dependent on. Instead, I’m trying to adapt to the changing weather patterns. I've invested in new irrigation systems and water storage tanks, hoping to make the most of the rain when it does come. I've also started experimenting with new varieties of coffee plants that are more resistant to drought and rust. Hopefully, there can be better implementations of policies and financial supports from our government as we are not the only ones struggling.
